                             Express, React, and various other frameworks and libraries. With most of my work being Full Stack 
                             applications, I have dealt with databases such as MongoDb and SQL. The few projects that arenâ€™t 
                             Full Stack, are written in Vanilla Js, jQuery, and limited Python.</p>
